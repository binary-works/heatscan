  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data in compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you submit this form, we collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name (if provided)</li>
    <li>Your email address</li>
    <li>Your phone number (optional)</li>
    <li>Any message you submit via the form</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use your data to respond to your enquiry and manage communications related to our business. Additionally, we retain certain client data for legal and tax compliance purposes, including possible checks by HMRC.</p>

  <h2>3. Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>
  <p>We process your data based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your explicit consent, given when you check the box agreeing to this privacy policy.</li>
    <li>Legal obligations to retain data for tax and regulatory compliance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored securely in password-protected systems (email and laptop) and is accessible only to authorised personnel. Appropriate technical and organisational measures are in place to protect your personal data.</p>

  <h2>5. Retention</h2>
  <p>We will retain your personal data only as long as necessary to respond to your enquiry or as required by law for tax and regulatory purposes (typically at least 5 years for HMRC compliance). After this period, emails and any spreadsheets containing client data will be deleted.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-party Processing</h2>
  <p>We use <a href="https://formsubmit.site" target="_blank">FormSubmit</a> to process form submissions. FormSubmit forwards your submission to our email and then deletes it from their servers. We remain responsible for retention, storage, and access of the data once it is received by us.</p>

    <li>Access the personal data we hold about you</li>
    <li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your data, except where retention is required by law</li>
